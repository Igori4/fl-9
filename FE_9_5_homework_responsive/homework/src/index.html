                  <p class="article-text">&nbsp;&nbsp;In reality both sides of the Moon see  the same amount of sunlight however only one face of the Moon is ever seen from Earth.This is becouse the Moon rotates around on its own axis in exacly the same time it takes to orbit the Earth, meaning the same side is alweys facing the Earth. The side facing awey from Earth has only been seen by the human eye from spacecraft</p>

                   <p class="article-text">&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two buges in the Earth due to the gravitational pull that the Moon exerts; one on the side acing the Moon.and the other on the opposite side that faces away from the Moon. The  bulges move around the oceans as the Earth rotates, causing high and low tides around the globe</p>

                   <p class="article-text">&nbsp;&nbsp;The Moon is moving approximately 3.8 cm away from our planet every year. It is estimated that it will countinue to do so for around 50 billion years. By the time that happens, the Moon will be taking around 47 days to orbit the Earth instead the current 27.3 days.</p>

                    <p class="article-text">&nbsp;&nbsp;The Moon has much weaker gravity than Earth, due to its  smaller mass, so tou would weigh about one sixth (16.5%) of your weight on Earth. This is why the lunar astronaits could leap and bound so high in the air </p>

Since then the Moon has only be visited by unmanned vehicles.</p>

                  <p class="article-text">&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that the surface of the Moon is unprotected from cosmic rays, mereorites and solar winds, and has huge temperature variations. The lack of atmosphere means no sound can be heard on the Moon, and the sky always appears black.</p>

                <p class="article-text">&nbsp;&nbsp;These are caused by the gravitational pull of the Earth. Lunar astronauts used seasmographs on their visits to  the Moon, and found that small moonquakes occured several kilometres beneath the surface, causing ruptures and cracks. Scientists think the Moon has a molten core, ust like Earth.</p>
